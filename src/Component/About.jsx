              I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define
              myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality
              is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging
              myself, and do interesting things that matter.
              <br /> <br />
              Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily
              inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever
              they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit
              with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never
              satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost
              impulsive need to act on them.
